                        Among the children of men, there is only one Lord who on Earth where we are has served you with all his heart. 
                        Advancing towards Calvary, He said, oh charity! â€œHere I am: I come, my Father,
                        To do your will.

                    <p>
                        Let it bend to your will Mine, day after day; May I obey with joy At the orders of your love, There is not, in heaven itself,
                        Highest bliss, Than that of a heart that loves you And who does your will.

                        I want to follow in his footsteps: Hear, O God! my desire, And from now on I do From your law all my pleasure;
                        Freed from slavery Of my false freedom, My food, my drink, Father, this is your will.
